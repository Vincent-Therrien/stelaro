	abstract = {Better interrogation of antimicrobial resistance requires new approaches to detect the associated genes in metagenomic samples. Targeted enrichment is an ideal method for their sequencing and characterization. However, no open-source, up-to-date hybridization probe set targeting antimicrobial resistance genes exists. Here we describe CARPDM, a probe design software package made to run alongside all future Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database releases. To test its efficacy, we have created and validated two separate probe sets: AllCARD, which enriches all genes encoded in the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database{\textquoteright}s protein homolog models (n = 4,661), and clinicalCARD, which focuses on a clinically relevant subset of resistance genes (n = 323). We demonstrate that allCARD increases the number of reads mapping to resistance genes by up to 594-fold. ClinicalCARD performs similarly when clinically relevant genes are present, increasing the number of resistance-gene mapping reads by up to 598-fold. In parallel with this development, we have established a protocol to synthesize any probe set in-house, saving up to 350 dollars per reaction. Together, these probe sets, their associated design program CARPDM, and the protocol for in-house synthesis will democratize metagenomic resistome analyses, allowing researchers access to a cost-effective and efficient means to explore the antibiotic resistome.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
